BoxMed-RL

Official repository for:

“Reason Like a Radiologist: Chain-of-Thought and Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Report Generation”
Medical Image Analysis, 2025

BoxMed-RL is a unified training framework designed to make vision–language models generate radiology reports that are both clinically coherent and spatially verifiable. The system couples medical chain-of-thought reasoning with reinforcement learning driven by bounding-box rewards, enabling the model to reason explicitly and justify findings in a manner closer to radiologist behavior.

This repository will host the full implementation of the BoxMed-RL pipeline, including:

Medical Concept Learning (MCL)

Spatially Verifiable Reinforcement (SVR)

LoRA-based downstream report-generation adapters

Evaluation scripts for localization, CheXbert, GEMA/GreenScore, and NLG metrics

Code release is ongoing. Dataset documentation for the included materials is already available inside each folder.
